Time flows like a river,
Carrying dreams and tears,
Each moment a precious gem,
Collected through the years.

We chase tomorrow's promise,
While yesterday fades away,
But wisdom lies in knowing,
Today is here to stay.

The past is but a shadow,
The future just a dream,
The only truth we own,
Is this present moment's gleam.

So let us not be prisoners,
Of what was or might be,
But dance within this instant,
And truly learn to see.
