In the vast expanse of cosmos,
Where stars are born and die,
We search for deeper meaning,
Beneath the endless sky.

No cosmic voice will tell us,
What we're supposed to be,
The meaning that we're seeking,
Lives in you and me.

We paint our own significance,
With choices that we make,
Each act of love and kindness,
A ripple in time's wake.

So let us be the authors,
Of stories yet untold,
And find that life's true treasure,
Is not silver, but pure gold.
