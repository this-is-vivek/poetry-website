In your eyes I find my home,
A place where love resides,
Two souls dancing as one,
Where passion never hides.

Your touch ignites my spirit,
Your voice calms every storm,
In this embrace eternal,
Our love takes perfect form.

Through seasons we shall wander,
Hand in hand, heart to heart,
No distance could divide us,
No force could pull apart.

You are my dawn, my sunset,
My anchor in the night,
With you, the world is perfect,
With you, everything's right.
