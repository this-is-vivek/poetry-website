Golden rays embrace the sky,
As we watch the day goodbye,
Hand in hand beneath the stars,
Love has healed our deepest scars.

Crimson clouds like painted dreams,
Mirror love's eternal streams,
In this moment, you and I,
Pledge our hearts beneath the sky.

Evening whispers soft and low,
Of the love we've come to know,
Sunset fades but love remains,
Through joy and sorrow, sun and rains.
