Among the towering ancient trees,
Where dappled sunlight falls,
I find my sanctuary here,
Within these living walls.

The forest speaks in whispered tones,
Of centuries gone by,
Each ring within the mighty oak,
A story reaching high.

Moss carpets every fallen log,
Ferns unfurl like prayers,
And in this green cathedral,
All my worry disappears.

Here time moves slow and steady,
Like roots beneath the ground,
In nature's sacred temple,
True peace at last is found.
