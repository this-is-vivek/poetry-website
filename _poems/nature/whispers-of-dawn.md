Morning dew kisses the earth,
Sunlight dances through leaves,
A symphony of awakening,
As nature gently breathes.

Golden rays pierce the mist,
Birds sing their morning song,
The world comes alive again,
Where peaceful moments belong.

Dewdrops catch the early light,
Like diamonds on the grass,
Each blade a tiny miracle,
As morning shadows pass.

The air is crisp and clean,
With promises anew,
Dawn whispers ancient secrets,
Of earth and sky so blue.
