The midnight train pulls slowly,
From the station in my dreams,
Its whistle cuts through silence,
Nothing's quite what it seems.

I climb aboard with luggage,
Full of memories and hope,
The conductor asks no questions,
As with uncertainty I cope.

Through moonlit fields we travel,
Past sleeping countryside,
Each mile takes me further,
From the past I've left behind.

At dawn we reach the station,
Where new adventures wait,
The midnight train has brought me,
To my chosen twist of fate.

Some journeys end in places,
Others in states of mind,
The midnight train of changes,
Leaves nothing unchanged behind.
